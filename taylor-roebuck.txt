        *takes deep breath* Ok, so. First you want to fork. Then, you add your TL as a collaborator. 
        Next, clone your Repo. Go to your Terminal and use the cd command to go to the directory you want to
        put your forked Repo. Next, use the git clone <link to repo> command. Then cd into the new Repo using
        cd <repo name>. Next you'll want to create your own branch with git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname'. 
        Now work on your Repo. When done, use the git add . command to make your changes ready for committing.
        Now you commit using git commit -m "Helpful commit-related message here". Next, you'll push your changes
        to your Github repo: git push -u origin branch-name. Go back to Github. Add your TL as a reviewer.
        Now you may submit a PR (make sure you're on your new forked copy and not on the original Lambda one). 

Stretch Questions

        I believe the answer is by using the box model.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1
